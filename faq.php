    <div>  <h2 style="color:white">What is the Difference between Mountainbikes and Roadbikes?</h2>
            
            <p>Aside from the difference in tyre size and tread pattern or the lack of suspension forks, the most striking visual difference between a road and mountain bike, is what you hold onto. Road bikes have narrow drop handlebars, while mountain bikes have wide flat bars</p>

            <div class="line"></div>

            <h2 style="color:white">Why do Roadbike have thin tires?</h2>
            
            <p>They simulate the sensation of higher speed â€“ without actually going faster. That is what narrow tires do. They are inflated to a higher pressure, so they transmit more small road irregularities. This means that they vibrate at higher frequencies than wider tires.</p>

            <h2  style="color:white">Which is faster between MTB & RB?</h2>
            <p>A road bicycle is 10 to 30% faster than a mountain bike and is 15% faster on average at the same power output on smooth, paved surfaces. Riding posture, rolling resistance, frame geometry, and weight are the main reasons for road bikes being faster with the same level of effort.</p>

            <h2 style="color:white">Can we use Roadbike in offroads?</h2>
            <p>Road bikes can definitely handle offroad conditions. A good example is the Paris-Roubaix race. In this race there are a lot of roads built out of old cobble stones. Often riders will ride of the side of the cobbled sections which is basically hard packed dirt (or mud, depending on the weather).</p>

            <h2 style="color:white">Why do Mountain bikes have big gears?</h2>
            <p>Gears allow you to change the pedaling speed (known as cadence) and effort required when riding up or down a hill. The mechanics are pretty simple, by changing the gear ratio, you are changing the amount of forward distance per pedal stroke.</p>

            <h2 style="color:white">what is the purpose of bended handle bars of roadbikes?</h2>
            <p>Road bike handlebars are curved primarily because they give riders a variety of positions for their hands. This is helpful on long bike rides, so riders can shift their hands and relieve the weight and pressure. Curved handlebars also allow riders to become more aerodynamic.</p>

            <h2 style="color:white">why is Roadbike is very light?</h2>
            <p>Yes, a lighter bike is easier to pedal up hills, faster to accelerate, and quicker to change direction. (That might not be a good thing for most riders.) But the real reason the bike industry is so utterly obsessed with weight is that it's a simple metric to demonstrate improvement.</p>

            <h2 style="color:white">Can we use Mountain bike in all terrain?</h2>
            <p>Riding a mountain bike on the road might sound odd, but it is a fairly common practice, especially since mountain bikes can ride well on both flat and rugged terrains. Mountain bikes can be ridden well on streets and roads, but this is determined by the type of bike chosen.</p>

            <h3 style="color:white">why mountain bike have big nob in tires?</h3>
            <p>The primary benefit of a fat bike is that they're able to travel over diverse terrain, from snow to sand, better than regular bicycles. The wide tyres provide you with extra grip and traction, and combined with a low tyre pressure, you'll find that you're able to pedal over terrain that'd make conventional tyres sink.</p>
